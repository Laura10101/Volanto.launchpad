##Design 
###Colour scheme 
The colour scheme will be……TBC! Likely violet, pink and navy. Neon. These colours have been designed to be reminiscent of a tech future: inspiration has been drawn from the neon lights of Tokyo and ‘Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?’ - a world where technology reigns. 
The colours have also been designed to ensure that they are not sterotupically masculine. The pink and lilac, used in a neon fashion, are designed to appeal to both men and women, rather than cementing the tech gender gap further. 
###Typography	
The fonts used will be…………………..
###Imagery 
Images are designed to reflect the theme of a future reigned by tech. They are bold, vivid, full of energy.
