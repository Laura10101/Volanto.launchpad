                            <li>Training and skills suggestions - perhaps there is a particular language or framework you should focus on for your career choice</li>
                            <li>Job seeking preparation and interview advice</li>
                            <li>The benefit of your mentors network</li>

                <h2>What is expected from you?</h2>
