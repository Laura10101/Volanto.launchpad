# Volanto Launchpad

There is a tension in the tech world that has accelerated rapidly in recent times. As the world becomes more tech-led, the demand for tech skills has increased drastically. Businesses are now struggling to hire the right skillsets.

At the same time, bootcamp and university graduates are struggling to secure their first roles. Graduates are often told that they lack experience and it is not uncommon to see entry level roles being advertised as requiring 2-5 years' experience.

Each of these problems are each others' solutions. There is not a shortage of candidates for tech roles, but there is a gap in the experience level that new graduates have, and the experience level that businesses want and expect. 

This is only exacerbated by the fact that candidates rarely ever receive meaningful, constructive feedback from unsuccessful applications. This means they simply do not know what to do to improve their chances of success.

Volanto is on a mission to change this.

Young people and career changers are at risk of becoming a generation whose skills are lost. When the industry is in such desperate need of talent, we cannot let this happen.

The Launchpad Scheme is designed to help people who are starting out in their technology careers, or looking to jump up the career ladder. The scheme pairs promising tech talent with an established tech professional who mentors them.

This website provides potential applicants with an online route to apply to the scheme, and with information to help them decide whether the scheme is right for them.

## Users
Users of this site will primarily be potential applicants to the Launchpad programme, which may include:
- People who are considering starting a career in tech.
- People looking to change careers.
- People looking to advance their tech careers.

We may also have Volanto clients looking at the site in order to understand more about Volanto's culture and brand values.

Primarily, therefore, the site must cater to potential applicants, whilst also maintaining an appropriate brand that reflects Volanto's values.

The application form is the call to action and must be easy to find and use.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the brand values of Volanto and the Launchpad Programme. Modern, futuristic, and unusual. Reminiscent of the neon lights of Tokyo and the film Bladerunner: worlds where technology reign.

I selected the following colours: 
- Navy blue: #100B44
- Violet: #e60073
- Vivid pink: #b414f3
- Green: #39c21a

The colour pallette is shown below:

![Volanto Launchpad Colour Palette](https://laura10101.github.io/volanto-launchpad/documentation/design/colours.jpg)

I also used a glow function when hovering over buttons to tie in with the neon theme.

### Typography

The preferred font is Nunito, with Helvetica as the web-safe font and Sans-serif as a fallback font. Nunito was imported from Google fonts.

Nunito was chosen because it is easy to read but also has a modern feel, which sits well with the brand values.

### Imagery
Images are designed to reflect the theme of a future reigned by tech. They are bold, vivid, full of energy. 

The header image was created by me, in Canva. The testimonial portrait images were taken from the Snappa image library. 

### Wireframes
To design my site I hand-sketched a set of low-fidelity wireframes. This was to assist me in planning the content and layout of elements on the page.

The wireframe for the home page is shown below:

- __The Footer__ 

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Volanto Launchpad. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
  - The footer is valuable to the user as it displays the relevant social media platforms that they can use to stay connected to Volanto.
  - It also displays copyright information for the site.
  - The footer is sticky so that it is always visible at the bottom of the page. Where the page is smaller than the screen, it will display at the bottom of the screen.

- __Programme page__

  - This page will allow users to understand the purpose of the Volanto Launchpad, who it is for (and therefore whether it will be suitable for them), and what they will need to do if they successfully apply.
  - It is laid out so that the text alignment is justify, but the text is centered in the middle of the screen.
  - On large devices, the content takes up just 50% of the screen to reduce the distance that the readers' eyes have to travel across the screen.
  - On mobile devices, this increases to 66% of the screen to account for a smaller device.

- __Application Form__

  - Users who wish to benefit from the Volanto Launchpad programme will need to apply to the programme.
  - To make this easy for potential applicants, the site provides an online application form.
  - All fields on the form are required to ensure the applicant can be properly contacted, and to encourage them to enter sufficient information to allow Volanto to make a fair decision on whether to accept them to the programme or not.

  - The testimonials page adds value for potential applicants by allowing them to see what benefit previous participants got from the Launchpad programme.
  - The page displays three testimonials, including the text of the testimonial as provided by the previous participant, and a photo of that participant.
  - On desktop devices, the testimonials are laid out such that the text for the testimonial is next to the portrait of the person who provided the testimonial.
  - On smaller devices, the testimonial text appears under the portrait.

- __Contact Form__

  - Some potential applicants, or clients who want to know more about Volanto's corporate culture, may need to contact us with queries or feedback.
  - The site therefore provides a standard Contact form.
  - All fields on the form are required so that Volanto is clear about who has contacted us and for what purpose, and to allow us the Volanto team to respond.

- __Submission confirmation pages__

 - When users submit an application through the online form, or contact us through the contact page, they will want to know that their form submission was successful.
 - The site therefore provides submission confirmation pages for both the contact and application forms.

Contact Confirmation page:
