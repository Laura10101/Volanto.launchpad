# Volanto Launchpad

There is a tension in the tech world that has accelerated rapidly in recent times. As the world become more tech-led, the demand for tech skills has increased drastically and  businesses are struggling to find the skills they need.

At the same time, bootcamp and university graduates are struggling to secure their first role. Many are at the point of despair.  Graduates are told time and time again that they lack experience. It is not uncommon to see entry level roles being advertised as requiring 2-5 years experience.

But each of these problems are each others' solutions. There is not a shortage of candidates for tech roles, but there is a gap in the experience level that new graduates have, and the experience level that businesses expect. Additionally, candidates rarely ever receive any meaningful, constructive feedback from unsuccessful job applications. This means they simply do not know what to do to improve their chances of success.

After advertising four entry level roles and receiving more than 200 applications for each position, Volanto is on a mission to change this.

Young people and career changers are at risk of becoming a generation whose skills are lost. When the industry is in such desperate need of talent, we cannot to let this happen.

The Launchpad Scheme is to help people who are starting out in their technology careers, or looking to jump up the career ladder. The scheme pairs promising tech talent with an established tech professional who mentors them.

This website provides potential applicants with an online route to apply to the scheme, and with information to help them decide whether the scheme is right for them.

##Users 
Users of this site will primarily be potential applicants to the Launchpad scheme, which may include:

We may also have Volanto clients looking at the site in order to understand more about Volanto's corporate culture.

## UX

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was chosen to reflect the brand values of Volanto and the Launchpad Programme. Modern, futuristic, and unusual. Reminiscent of the neon lights of Tokyo and the film Bladerunner: worlds where technology reign.

The Launchpad Programme is about closing the tech skills gap, and one of its aims is to encourage more people from under represented groups into technology. Women are a hugely under represented group, so it was important that the site appealed to a ...

I selected the following colours: 
- Navy blue: #100B44
- Violet: #e60073
- Vivid pink: #b414f3
- Green: #39c21a

The colour pallette is shown below:

![Volanto Launchpad Colour Palette](https://laura10101.github.io/volanto-launchpad/documentation/design/colour-palette.JPG)

I also used a glow function when hovering over buttons to tie in with the neon theme.

### Typography

The font used is Nunito: Helvetica: Sans-serif.  Nunito was imported frmo Google fonts. 

Nunito was chosen because it is easy to read but also has a modern feel, which sits well with the brand guidelines.

### Imagery
Images are designed to reflect the theme of a future reigned by tech. They are bold, vivid, full of energy. 

The header image was created by me, in Canva. The testimonial portrait images were taken from the Snappa image library. 

### Wireframes
To design my site I hand-sketched a set of low-fidelity wireframes. This was to assist me in planning the content and layout of elements on the page.

The wireframe for the home page is shown below:
